# Note & Code Editor

**Project Overview:**

This project represents my journey into developing a full-stack application using Java Swing and AWT libraries, crafted with NetBeans IDE. The Note & Code Editor is designed to mimic some functionalities of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with a focus on user-friendly text editing for both notes and code.

**Features:**

- **Java Swing and AWT Integration:** 
  - Utilized Swing components and AWT for creating an intuitive GUI, enhancing interaction and usability.

- **IDE-like Functionalities:**
  - **Syntax Highlighting:** Provides visual cues for better code readability.
  - **Code Formatting:** Assists in maintaining clean and organized code structures.

- **File and Database Management:**
  - Efficient saving, retrieval, and organization of both notes and code snippets in a database or file system.

**Key Components:**

- **Text Editor:** 
  - Two `JTextPane` components for editing and viewing content, with one being non-editable for displaying saved versions.
  - Custom `StyledDocument` listeners to manage unsaved changes.

- **Formatting Tools:**
  - Toolbar with buttons for bold and italic text formatting, font size selection, and text type (e.g., headings).

- **File Operations:**
  - Menu bar options for opening, saving, and saving as different versions of documents, including keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+S` for save).
 
**Technologies Used:**

- Java
- Java Swing & AWT
- NetBeans IDE

**Project Timeline:**

- **Start Date:** December 2024
- **End Date:** (Ongoing)
